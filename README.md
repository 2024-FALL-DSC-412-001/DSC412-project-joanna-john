# DSC412 Project - Employee Turnover Analysis and Prediction

This project explores the Employee Turnover Analytics Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshayhedau/employee-turnover-analytics-dataset) that contains features on 14,999 employees and whether they left the firm or not. The goal is to build models that uses these features to predict whether a given employee has quit and analyze their results.

**How to Run the Project**
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Install dependencies by running:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Ensure the dataset is saved as employee_turnover_data.csv in the working directory.
4. Open and run the notebook file in a Jupyter environment.
